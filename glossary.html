<dd>This is 1/20 of a game-second. This is primarily useful when talking about Lynx-logic solution, since Lynx-logic uses a clock of this resolution (and the display is also refreshed at the same rate). Unlike MS-logic, in Lynx-logic objects are generally allowed to start moving from one tile to another at any frame, which makes this term useful when you need to describe interactions that involve precise timing.</dd-->

<dd>
An acronym which stands for Microsoft Chip's Challenge.

<!--dt><a name="step" id="step">Step</a></dt>
<dd>This is 1/5 of a game-second. It's called a step because usually (not always) it takes an object (Chip, block, monsters) that much time to move from one tile completely into an adjacent tile. Most people would consider this movement as "stepping" into the adjacent tile, hence the term.</dd-->

<!--dt><a name="tick" id="tick">tick</a></dt>
<dd>
One tenth (1/10) of a second.
</dd-->

<dt><a name="tick" id="tick">Tick</a></dt>
<dd>
One tenth of a second. For a detailed explanation, read the <a href="http://chips.kaseorg.com/faq/cache/86.html">FAQ entry</a>.
</dd>
<!--dt><a name="tick" id="tick">Tick</a></dt>
<dd>This is 1/10 of a game-second. This is primarily useful when talking about MS-logic solutions, since MS-logic, at least as implemented in MS CC, uses a clock with this resolution in running the game. In MS-logic, objects that are slipping (eg. moving on ice, force floors, etc.) generally takes this much time in moving from one tile to the next.</dd-->
