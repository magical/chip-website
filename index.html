<h2>Info</h2>

<p>Chip's Challenge is a tile-based action/puzzle game created by Chuck Sommerville. It was originally written for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Lynx">Atari Lynx</a>, but was later ported to Windows (and other platforms) and included in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Entertainment_Pack">Windows Entertainment Pack 4</a>, where it gathered a small but devoted following. They called themselves the MSN Charter Chipsters.

Around 199X John Elion created ChipEdit.

<h2>Levels</h2>

<p>The original game had only 149 levels,
but with the invention of level editors,
fans have created thousands of their own levels.

<p>The community has put together three level packs from the fan levels. People voted on their favorite levels from nominated levelsets, and the winners were assembled by a team of volunteers.

<p>The first level pack was released on February 09, 2002.
It was titled CCLP2, or Chip's Challenge Level Pack 2,
the numeral indicating that it was intended as a sequel to the original levelset.
I don't recommend this level set because many of the levels rely on buggy behaviours and misfeatures of the Microsoft version of Chip's Challenge.

<p>The next level pack, CCLP3 was released on December 24, 2010. This time, the community decided that all of the levels should be playable in Tile World's Lynx ruleset, which more accurately emulates the original game.
Levels range from slightly tricky to truly diabolical, especially a couple of real stumpers by pieguy.

<p>The third level pack was released on March 28, 2014. Just to be confusing, it is named CCLP1. Just like CCLP3, all the levels are playable in the Lynx ruleset. In contrast to CCLP3, however, the levels lean a bit more towards the easy side.
But that shouldn't be taken to mean that they are boring!
On the contrary, I have found CCLP1 to be quite fun and engaging, and evenâ€”dare i say it-challenging. Just not to the same hair-pulling degree as CCLP3.
A solid introductory levelset.

<p>First, if you haven't played the original levelset, I would recommend starting there. It's a little hard to come by, but I'm sure you can find it if you try. (You're looking for the CHIPS.DAT file included with the Microsoft version of Chip's Challenge, which itself was included in <abbr title="Best Of Windows Entertainment Pack">BOWEP</abbr> and <abbr title="Windows Entertainment Pack 4">WEP4</abbr>.)

<p>If you've already played the original levelset and are hungry for more, look no further than <abbr title="Chip's Challenge Level Pack 2">CCLP2</abbr>, a "best of" set put together by the community in Febuary 09, 2002.

<h3 id=mylevels>My Levelsets</h3>
<p>
My first levelset was AndrewE1.dat. When I started working on it, my goal was to create a new 149-level levelset, complete with secret levels and "lessons", but I realize now that I was being way too ambitious. My current goal is to create two ~20-level sets; one for the Lynx ruleset, and one for the MSCC ruleset.

<h3>Level Editors</h3>

<p><a href="https://wiki.bitbusters.club/ChipEdit">Wiki page</a> | Latest version: 3.56 (2004-03-01)
<p>This was the first ever Chip's Challenge level editor.
<p>ChipEdit uses a primitive strategy for playtesting, from before we knew of better methods: it replaces CHIPS.DAT and entpack.ini with your levelset, launches the game, and puts them back when the game exits. This <i>works</i>, but it is very easy to lose your scores if you are not careful, or if ChipEdit crashes.
<p>ccexplore has created a <a href="http://www.davidstolp.com/old/chips/patches/pgchipedit.zip">modified version</a> which lets you create levels for <a href="#pgchip">pgchip</a>.

<p>A different sort of level editor&mdash;c4 is actually a command-line utility that converts levelsets between various formats (Brian wrote it while developing Tile World). It supports a special text-based format which is suitable for creating levels with (especially ones with strange and "illegal" button connections, or duplicate monster list entries).

<p>The only way to edit the levels of the original Lynx version is with c4. You create the levels in a normal editor and use c4 to inject them into the ROM.

<p>There are a few patches that people have produced for the Windows port of Chip's Challenge.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="MyChips.zip">MyChips</a>, created by Dale Bryan</dt>
<dd>Creates a modified version of chips.exe which uses different .ini and .dat files. Comes with source code in C.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.pvv.org/~spaans/old/download/other.html">T-Chip</a>, created by Ruben Spaans</dt>
<dd><p>Grants 999 seconds on all untimed levels in the original levelset. (Will not work with any other levelset.)</p></dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/pub/software/tworld/chipend">chipend</a>, created by Brian Raiter</dt>
<dd><p>This perl script changes the end level numbers stored in the exe, to avoid the "Corrupt or inaccessible CHIPS.DAT" message. It can also suppress the <a href="https://wiki.bitbusters.club/Decade_message">decade messages</a>.</p></dd>

<dt id=cchack><a href="http://cctools.zrax.net/">CCHack</a>, created by Michael Hansen</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This program allows you to customize nearly everything about chips.exe,
including the program title, the decade messages, the ending level, the death messages, etc.
But most importantly it lets you change the graphics.

<p>Part of CCTools.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.davidstolp.com/old/chips/patches/ccpatch.html">ccpatch</a>, created by ccexplore</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Fixes the bug in MSCC which causes the game to crash when Chip enters a square containing two transparent tiles (monsters, keys and boots) or a transparent tile on a block.
</p>

<p>pieguy explains:</p>
<blockquote>
the rule for
determining if chip can enter a tile is to check the bottom layer only
if the top tile is transparent (which is done recursively).  however, if
the bottom layer is also transparent, then it will recursively check the
bottom layer again (it doesn't try to look "below" the bottom layer, it
just rechecks the same layer) until eventually the stack overflows and
the game crashes.
</blockquote>
<p>CC Wiki also has a page about this bug: <a href="https://wiki.bitbusters.club/Transparency_Glitch">Transparency Glitch</a>
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.davidstolp.com/old/chips/patches/fullsec.html">fullsec</a>, created by ccexplore</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Fixes another bug in the game, where the timer fails to fully reset. Also adds the ability to switch the game between even- and odd-step mode. (<a href="https://wiki.bitbusters.club/Odd_and_even_step">Huh?</a>)
</p>
</dd>

<dt id=pgchip><a href="http://www.davidstolp.com/old/chips/patches/pgchip.html">pgchip</a>, created by David "pieguy" Stolp</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Adds ice blocks to MSCC.  Ice blocks are a tile from CC2. You can push several ice blocks at once; they turn fire into water and water into ice; they also remove dirt and can be pushed by tanks and teeth.
<p>
I've written a similar patch for Tile World, which you can find in my
<a href="https://github.com/magical/tworld/tree/iceblock">tworld/iceblock</a>
branch on github.

<h2>Tilesets</h2>
<p>Several very talented people have created their own custom tilesets for Chip's Challenge. Tile World makes it very easy for you to use an alternate tileset  &mdash; it just requires changing a line in the <code>rc</code> file (see the <a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tworld/tworld.html#4">documentation</a>). To change the tileset in MSCC, you will need to use <a href="#cchack">CCHack</a>.
<p>My favorite tilesets are <a href="#kayu">The Kayu Interface</a> for MSCC, and <a href="#retroremixcc">Retro Remix CC</a> for Lynx.
</p>

Anders Kaseorg created this tileset for the 1.0 release of <a href="#tileworld">Tile World</a>
using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POV-Ray">POV-Ray</a>, a ray-tracing program, which gives it a 3-D look.
Anders has released this tileset to the Public Domain.
<p>
Michael Hansen later used the tileset in a graphical patch for MSCC, dubbed "<a href="graphics/NewAgeCC.zip">New Age CC</a>", to demonstrate CCHack.
<p>
<a href="http://cczone.invisionzone.com/index.php?/files/file/417-atilesbmp/">Deanimated</a>.
Simon L has created a version of this tileset without animations for any of the static tiles (the monsters are still animated), if you're the sort that finds that distracting.
</p>


<h3 id=naturalcc><a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/group/chips_challenge/files/Keyboard%20Wielder/">Natural CC</a>, created by Madhav Shanbhag</h3>

<p>
Natural CC takes place in a sprawling field, where Chip runs around collecting (potato) chips, and avoiding quick-sand and lava.
<p>
Madhav created a program, patchbmp, so he could distribute this tileset without including the original (copyrighted) tileset (and also to keep the file size down).
It doesn't seem to have caught on (I haven't seen any other tilesets using patchbmp) but then again, most other tilesets are complete makeovers, rather than a partial change like Natural CC.
<p>
Natural CC can be pretty fun&mdash;it really changes the feel of the game. Try playing On The Rocks with Natural CC to see for yourself.

<p>
Kayu's Enhanced Interface gives the Chip's Challenge graphics a much needed upgrade, with shinier tiles and a softer, calmer feel overall.

<p>
While developing Tile World, Brian needed a tileset to test it with, so he quickly drew this one up.
It was later replaced by <a href="#newage">Anders's 3-D tileset</a>, but the beta tileset can still be found on the Tile World website, if you know where to look.
<a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/pub/software/tworld/tiles-48x48-4bpp.zip">[download]</a>
<a href="graphics/sillyworld-orig.zip">[mirror]</a>

<p>The beta tileset is too large to use in MSCC as-is, so I resized it and converted it to MSCC's "masked" format.
I call my version <a href="sillyworld.zip">Silly World</a>.</p>

Nicholas Morales hand-drew this awesome tileset on graph paper with colored pencils.

<a href="http://www.harteex.com/?page=chipworld">Chip World</a> is a Chip's Challenge clone written for the Dingoo portable gaming system. It has a pretty awesome looking (though small) tileset.

<dd>The former central repository for levelsets. Febuary 28th, 2000 &endash; December 14th, 2019.
Shut down in 2019 when Yahoo! removed all user content from groups.

<dt><!--a href="news://news.annexcafe.com/annexcafe.chips.challenge">The official Chip's Challenge newsgroup</a-->
    <a>annexcafe.chips.challenge<a> - the official Chip's Challenge newsgroup
<dd>
  The newsgroup was the main forum for CC discussion and score reports.
  Not sure when it was created, but it has existed since at least March 1st, 2000
  <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/chips_challenge/conversations/messages/14">[1]</a>.
  It was active from 2000 to around 2012, when usage started to taper off in favor of CC Zone.
  It shut down in 2015(?) due to the host, annexcafe, shutting down their news server.

  <!-- Anders's <a href="http://chips.kaseorg.com/newsgroup/">web interface</a>. -->
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://cczone.invisionzone.com/">CCZone</a></dt>
<dd>
  <p>CCZone was created in 2012 as an alternative to the newsgroup.
    It slowly gained popularity as the main place for discussion, replacing the newsgroup, which became mainly used for score reports.
    A similar thing seems to have happened with the Discord group: discussion has moved from CCZone to Discord, and now the CCZone is mainly used for score reports.

  <p>CCZone also hosts files - levelsets, solution files, tilesets, and level editors &amp; other programs.
